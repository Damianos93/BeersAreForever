     So this was quite the journey.I managed to do an all beer page that you can change with a next page button.Had some issues there with
multiple beers showing but i see these on the api's these multiple beers and when you click on the beers that are looped you can see different id's.Also i had to learn how to use hooks.A concept i was exposed to the last 2 days so i am not so honed there.Just tutorials and videos.
    
     The hardest parts were search by type and country.By country i have a problem that you cant see the countries and can click on them straight away but you have to write it on the search bar first and then you can see them.If you click on them then you can see the beers on each one.The search by type was a little tricky with where the names were.

     I had another problem with reachcing maximum call stacks for the api so i used a different key in the end.In the beggining i had a cors problem that i overcame with proxy on dependencies.I wanted to use tailwind for css but unfortunatelly i do not have the time.

     It seemed way easier in the beggining and of course as the time went by i was destroying my own code and had to repair after myself.
If i had more than 5 days i would try to fix these bugs as well but i am not sure if i can do something more without studying first which takes time by itself.

     Thank you, Damianos Makris.
